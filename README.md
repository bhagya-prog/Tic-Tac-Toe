# ❌⭕ Tic Tac Toe – The Classic Game Reimagined

A fun and stylish version of the classic **Tic Tac Toe** game built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  <br>
Play with a friend, track your turns, and enjoy the sleek UI that makes every move satisfying!


## 🎮 How to Play

- Two players take turns: one plays ❌ and the other plays ⭕
- First to align three in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins
- If all boxes are filled and no one wins – it's a draw!
- Click **Reset** to start a new game anytime

## 🖥️ Run It Locally

1. Clone the repo:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/bhagya-prog/Tic-Tac-Toe.git
2. Open the folder and double-click **index.html**<br>
OR <br>
Use **Live Server** in VSCode for the best experience

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
1. HTML – Game structure

2. CSS – Stylish grid and animations

3. JavaScript – Game logic & win conditions

## 💡 Future Plans
1. **Add score tracking** : Here the person who wins will get 1 point and I will keep on upgrading it and showing it on the top as a score tracker. 

2. **Add sound effects** : I will add sound effects for different moments, like ⭕ winning the game or ❌ winning the game or even if it is a TIE. 

3. **Enable AI mode (player vs computer)** : Here the AI will take random locations on the palette not the one chosen by the person, and the rest of the code remains the same which just minute changes to it as well. 

4. **Add dark/light theme toggle** : A simple toggle button to change mode according to the user's need.

#### Will Bring these changes very soon !!!
