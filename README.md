# Tic-Tac-Toe <br>

In this code, I have created a simple looking game and it has a cursor which is created by me. It tracks the position of the cursor on the webpage and hence created a custom cursor for it. <br>

This code has HTML, CSS, JS in it. <br>

In this game, if a user wins it will show the hidden div added (winner name) and then the scroll will be switched off.
